## üöÄ How to Use

- Each script is self-contained and outputs results to a `.txt` file on your **Desktop** using its filename.
- The toolkit includes an **interactive PowerShell menu** to easily navigate and execute 

‚úÖ When downloading from the internet, Windows blocks .ps1 files. You must unblock them:
To unblock and make this scripts run Powershell as administrator and folllow the steps below

1.  Run this PowerShell command after unzipping:
  Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Path\To\Folder" -Filter *.ps1 | Unblock-File

2. Allow PowerShell Script Execution Temporarily
By default, PowerShell blocks custom scripts. To allow them only for this session:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

Alternatively, to make it permanent system-wide (not recommended on production systems):
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

 3. Run the Interactive Menu Script
After unblocking and setting execution policy, launch the menu:
   cd "C:\Path\To\Toolkit"
   .\_interactive_menu_for_phase_I.ps1

4. Run Individual Scripts Manually
To run any script directly without the interactive menu, example:
.\re-enable_windows_defender.ps1
